# Binary Prediction with Rainfall Dataset

This folder contains my work for the [Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 3](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e3) Kaggle competition.

## Competition Overview
- **Type**: Binary Classification
- **Goal**: Predict rainfall occurrence (binary: rain or no rain) using weather data
- **Evaluation Metric**: AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)
- **Data Source**: Based on Hong Kong Weather Observation data (2015-2016)

## Approach

### Completed Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values
- Feature correlation analysis
- Baseline model implementation
- Feature engineering
- Advanced models testing
- Cross-validation

### Planned Next Steps
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Ensemble methods
- Further feature refinement

## Results
TBD
<!-- 
- **Current AUC Score**: 0.8726
- **Model**: Logistic Regression with default parameters
- **Leaderboard Position**: 1321/2792
-->

## Key Learnings
TBD
